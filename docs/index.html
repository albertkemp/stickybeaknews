      <h2>Myna egg thief captured</h2>

            <h2>Eagles fly high</h2>
            <h3>First eagles in space</h3>
            <p>The Eagle Spacecraft Design Department has finally completed the new spacecraft technology, and a team of brave eagles have finally travelled into space.</p>
            <p>&quot;I am so happy that we have finally achieved this goal," says ESDD leader Alan Spacey. &quot;If we keep developing our spacecraft at this rate we can soon expect to land on the moon. This is a great achievement for all birds.&quot;</p>

              <h2>Polyethylene wings revolutionise market</h2>
              <p>The new Polyethylene made wings are revolutionising the market for elderly and flightless birds. Amazingly, these perfectly crafted wings can be easily applied and function as well as genuine bird wings, if not better becuse they do not need moulting or preening. Thanks to the Bird Aerospace Market, elderly and flightless birds can now fly with ease.</p>
                <p>&quot;I am delighted to be able to help the birds with the lack of flight,&quot; says Professor A. Flapper, who is the leading bird in the science of wings. &quot;I have finally created a wing that can produce sufficient lift without too much power used, while being comfortable and easy to put on and take off. I hope that this new product will be suitable for the customers in need.&quot;</p><br>
                <h2>Bird baby victim of eagle</h2>
                <p>A baby bird belonging to the Fluttersnoop family has been likely abducted by an eagle. Bystanders report seeing an eagle making off with a small chick just outside the Fluttersnoops' house. </p>
                <p>&quot;I am just devastated!&quot; says Mrs. Fluttersnoop. &quot;He was always an innocent little chick, how wicked of the eagle to take him away.&quot; The location of the eagle and chick is still unknown, and the BPS have been inquiring into the exact time when the chick was last seen. &quot;The eagle was mosty brown all over with a black mark under his eye and yellow legs,&quot; reports a bystander. &quot;I hope they can soon find the little chick.&quot;</p>
